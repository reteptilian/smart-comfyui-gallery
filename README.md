## ComfyUI-Aware. ComfyUI-Independent.

SmartGallery DAM runs as a fully independent process, outside ComfyUI's environment. It keeps indexing and organizing your library whether ComfyUI is up, down, updating, or completely uninstalled. No custom node, no shared dependencies.

SmartGallery DAM is *ComfyUI-aware* (it reads workflows, extracts prompts, understands models and LoRAs) but *ComfyUI-independent* by design. Your DAM outlives any tool it connects to.

**What this means in practice:**

- ComfyUI is broken after a Python update? SmartGallery keeps running.
- Run it alongside ComfyUI on the same machine on a different port. Or install it on a separate machine or laptop and just link the output folder over the network.
- You switched tools entirely? SmartGallery works on *any* folder of media. It was never ComfyUI-only to begin with.

---

## The Best Mobile Experience in Its Class

> **We are not aware of any other self-hosted media manager with a mobile interface this good.**

SmartGallery DAM was built responsive from day one, not as an afterthought. 

This is cross-platform in the full sense: **Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker**, accessible from any browser on any device on your network, including tablets and smartphones.

## 1. OVERVIEW & CONCEPTS

### 1.1 What is SmartGallery DAM?

**SmartGallery DAM** is the evolution of *SmartGallery for ComfyUI*. What started as a fast local gallery for browsing outputs has grown into a powerful and easy-to-use **Digital Asset Management system**. 

Evolve your workflow from a simple collection of files into a structured, searchable library. Designed for individual creators and professional teams, this platform is ridiculously simple to use, yet powerful enough to act as the ultimate file manager for your generations. Every asset is automatically indexed, linked to its original generative parameters, and ready for secure review. The system is open-source, private, and entirely local: no cloud dependencies and no recurring costs.

**Who is this for?**

**The AI Artist.** You run ComfyUI all day. Your output folder has tens of thousands of files and you can never find anything. SmartGallery lives outside that chaos. It indexes every generation with its full workflow, lets you search by prompt, model or LoRA, and lets you cull while batches are still running. When ComfyUI breaks, SmartGallery doesn't even blink.

**The Creative Pro or Team.** You deliver AI visuals to clients. Sharing via Google Drive or Dropbox feels unprofessional. SmartGallery gives you an optional Exhibition portal where clients rate and comment on images in real time, while your prompts and workflows stay completely invisible to them. Launch it only when you have a delivery to share.

**Everyone else.** You just want to organize photos, videos, or art and share them nicely. SmartGallery works with any folder on your system.  

**The Remote or Multi-Machine User.** You want your gallery on a dedicated machine (a laptop, a NAS, a home server) without installing ComfyUI there. Install SmartGallery on that machine, link your ComfyUI output folder over the network, and access the full DAM from any browser, on any device, including your phone.

---

### 1.4 Use Case Scenarios

SmartGallery has two interfaces: the **Main Interface** (your personal workspace) and **Exhibition** (an optional sharing portal for clients, collaborators, or friends). They are completely independent. You can run just the Main Interface forever and never touch Exhibition. You can launch Exhibition only when you have something to share and shut it down when the review is over. Neither requires the other to be running.

<details>
<summary><strong>Scenario 1: Solo user, no sharing needed (upgrading from v1)</strong></summary>

If you used SmartGallery v1 as an advanced file manager and have no need to share your work, nothing changes. Launch it exactly as before, with no extra parameters:

```bash
python smartgallery.py
```

ComfyUI is generating hundreds of files. As each one appears in the grid, you decide in real time: delete the bad seeds immediately with `Del`, move the keepers to the right folder with `M`, mark favorites with `F`, or tag them with a color status. You do all of this while generation is still running. When you want to review later, you search by prompt keywords, model name, or LoRA, pull up the full node summary for any image from months ago, or compare two generations side by side with a parameter diff.

When ComfyUI is not running, the same interface works as a full file manager for all your media. No Exhibition needed, ever, unless you decide you want it.

What is new in v2 that you can start using immediately, with no additional setup:

-   **Virtual Collections:** group files from different folders into named albums without moving anything on disk. Open the Collections tab in the left sidebar and click + to create one.
-   **Status Tags:** mark any image with a workflow state using keys `1` to `5`. For example, press `3` to flag a file as "To Edit" and come back to it later. Browse all files with a given status from the Status tab in the sidebar.
-   **Ratings and personal notes:** press `G` on any image to open the Details panel. Assign a 1 to 5 star rating and write a note to yourself. These notes are searchable: use the comment keyword filter to find any image by words you wrote in your own comments.
-   **Clean Export:** to send a file to someone without exposing your ComfyUI workflow and models, press `Shift+W`. You get a pixel-perfect copy with all metadata stripped.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scenario 2: Sharing your work with Exhibition</strong></summary>

Exhibition is a separate, read-only portal you share with clients, collaborators, or anyone you want to show your work to.

**Step 1: Launch the Main Interface with authentication.**

> The line below shows only the launch command with the relevant parameters. In practice you should add these parameters to your platform launch script (the `.bat` or `.sh` file you created during installation), which also sets your folder paths and ffprobe location. If you have not created a launch script yet, see the [Installation](#21-installation) section, pick your platform, and follow the instructions there first.

```bash
python smartgallery.py --port 8189 --admin-pass yourpassword --force-login
```

Log in at `http://localhost:8189` with username `admin` (always lowercase) and the password you set above.

**Step 2: Create Collections and set Permissions.** In the left sidebar, open the Collections tab and click +. Give each collection a name. You can toggle it as "Exhibition Ready" (public for everyone in the portal), or click the `⋮` menu -> 👥 **Share / Permissions** to assign it exclusively to a specific client.

**Step 3: Create user accounts.** Click the user management icon in the sidebar. Create an account for each person who will access Exhibition. For clients and external viewers, assign the role CUSTOMER or USER. Share their credentials and the Exhibition URL with them directly.

**Step 4: Launch Exhibition.**

> Same as above: add these parameters to a second launch script for Exhibition (a separate `.bat` or `.sh` file), keeping your folder paths and other settings identical to the Main Interface script. Run it from a second terminal when you are ready to share.

```bash
python smartgallery.py --exhibition --port 8190 --admin-pass yourpassword
```

Share `http://youraddress:8190` with your users. They will see only the collections assigned to them, with no prompts, no workflow data, and no folder structure. They can leave star ratings and write comments on individual images. You can read and reply to their feedback from the Main Interface at any time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scenario 3: Small team working together (Blind Rating)</strong></summary>

The team lead runs the Main Interface with `--force-login` and `--admin-pass` so the workspace is password-protected. Each team member gets a STAFF account and logs into the same Main Interface remotely to review files, apply status tags, and leave internal comments on specific images.

```bash
python smartgallery.py --port 8189 --admin-pass yourpassword --force-login
```

When work is ready for a client, a CUSTOMER account is created, the relevant Collections are mapped, and Exhibition is launched on a separate port. To prevent the client (or team members) from being influenced by what others voted, the lead launches Exhibition with the `--blind-rating` flag:

```bash
python smartgallery.py --exhibition --port 8190 --admin-pass yourpassword --blind-rating
```

Now, when clients log into `http://youraddress:8190`, they cannot see the global average score. They only see their own stars. Admins reviewing the gallery can press `B` to toggle the blind mode off temporarily and see the real consensus. 

All feedback runs through the same database, with no file transfers, no email threads, and no ZIP files.

</details>

## 2. SETUP & CONFIGURATION

### 2.1 Installation

**Requirements:**
*   **Portable/Docker Installation:** No installation required. Everything is pre-configured (Python is already embedded).
*   **Manual Installation:** Python 3.10+ installed on your system.
*   **Strongly Recommended:** FFmpeg/FFprobe (for advanced video features).

> **Choose your platform below and expand to view the installation instructions:**
<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

There are two ways to run SmartGallery on Windows: using the ready-to-use **Portable Version** (Recommended) or the **Manual Git Installation**.

---

### Method 1: Portable Version (Recommended)
This version includes a fully self-contained environment. You do not need to install Python or any dependencies on your system—it is **completely plug-and-play**.

**1. Download & Extract**
* **Direct Download:** [SmartGallery-v2.14-Windows-Portable.zip](https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery/releases/download/2.14/SmartGallery-v2.14-Windows-Portable.zip) *(Link will be updated upon release)*
* **Releases Page:** Alternatively, view all builds on the [Releases page](https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery/releases/latest).
* Extract the archive into a folder of your choice.

**2. Configure and Run**
* **Read First:** Before launching, open the `00_START_HERE.txt` file included in the root folder for essential setup instructions.
* **Customize:** Rename `sample_run_smartgallery.bat` to `run_smartgallery.bat`, right-click it, and select **Edit**.
* **Setup Paths:** Update the `CONFIGURATION` section to point to your specific ComfyUI folders (ensure you use forward slashes `/`).
* **Launch:** Save the file and double-click `run_smartgallery.bat` to launch the server!

**3. Updating to a Newer Version**
To update to a newer release while preserving your settings:
1. Download and extract the new Portable ZIP into a fresh folder.
2. Simply copy your existing `run_smartgallery.bat` (and any custom `.bat` files for Exhibition Mode) into the new folder.
3. Launch your copied `.bat` file; your configuration will be preserved automatically.

*Note: SmartGallery DAM is completely standalone; your database and settings are kept safe in your chosen configuration path.*

  -v /your/host/input:/mnt/input \
  -v /your/host/SmartGallery:/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/output \
  -e BASE_INPUT_PATH=/mnt/input \
  -e BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` \
  -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` \
  # -e CLI_ARGS="..."   # Optional: add launch parameters here (see below)
  -p 8189:8189 \
  mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery
```

The `CLI_ARGS` environment variable passes optional launch parameters to SmartGallery inside the container. Add it to the command above depending on your scenario:

| Scenario | CLI_ARGS value | Port mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Main Interface with login | `--admin-pass yourpassword --force-login` | `-p 8189:8189` |
| Exhibition | `--exhibition --admin-pass yourpassword` | `-p 8190:8189` |
| Exhibition with guest access | `--exhibition --admin-pass yourpassword --enable-guest-login` | `-p 8190:8189` |
| Exhibition with Blind Rating | `--exhibition --admin-pass yourpassword --blind-rating` | `-p 8190:8189` |

For Exhibition scenarios, replace `-p 8189:8189` in the `docker run` command above with `-p 8190:8189`. This maps port 8190 on your host to the container's internal port 8189, so clients reach Exhibition at `http://youraddress:8190`.

When using `--admin-pass`, log in with username `admin` (always lowercase) and the password you set.

For running both instances simultaneously, see the dedicated section under [Launch Parameters](#22-launch-parameters).

**Update:**

```bash
docker pull mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery
docker stop smartgallery && docker rm smartgallery
# Re-run the docker run command above
```

### 2.2 Launch Parameters

The Main Interface and Exhibition are completely independent. You can run just one, both at the same time, or alternate between them. Neither requires the other to be running.

<details>
<summary><strong>Main Interface parameters</strong></summary>

All parameters are optional. Launched with no flags, SmartGallery runs on port 8189 and treats you as admin automatically when accessed from a local network.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port <number>` | Optional | Override the default port (8189). |
| `--admin-pass <pwd>` | Optional* | Set the Admin password. Required to enable user management. Minimum 8 characters. Log in with username `admin` (always lowercase) and the password you set here. |
| `--force-login` | Optional* | Enforces authentication. Must always be combined with `--admin-pass`. Use when accessing from outside the local network. |
| `--blind-rating` | Optional | Forces Blind Rating mode. Useful if you want team members in the main UI to vote without bias. |

`*` `--admin-pass` and `--force-login` must be used together when either is specified.

> **Accessing the main interface from outside your local network?** Always use `--admin-pass` and `--force-login` together, without exception. Without these two flags the interface is open to anyone who finds the URL.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Exhibition parameters</strong></summary>

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--exhibition` | Yes | Start in Exhibition Mode. Only assigned or public collections are visible. Physical folder browsing is disabled. |
| `--admin-pass <pwd>` | Yes | Set the Admin password. Required to protect the instance and enable user management. Minimum 8 characters. |
| `--port <number>` | Yes | Use a different port when running Exhibition alongside the main interface. Typically 8190. |
| `--enable-guest-login` | Optional | Shows a "Login as Guest" button. No account needed to browse Exhibition. |
| `--blind-rating` | Optional | **Blind Rating Mode.** Hides global average ratings from the UI. Users see and sort only by their own personal ratings, ensuring unbiased curation feedback from clients and guests. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Running both instances: together or independently</strong></summary>

The two instances can run at the same time from two separate terminals or scripts, or independently whenever needed. Launch Exhibition only when you have something to share. There is no requirement to keep both running permanently.

**Python: two terminals or scripts**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main interface
python smartgallery.py --port 8189 --admin-pass yourpassword --force-login

# Terminal 2: Exhibition (launch only when needed, with Blind Rating active)
python smartgallery.py --exhibition --port 8190 --admin-pass yourpassword --blind-rating
```

**Docker: same image, launched twice**

```bash
# Main interface container (port 8189 on host)
docker run --name smartgallery-main \
  -v /your/host/output:/mnt/output \
  -v /your/host/input:/mnt/input \
  -v /your/host/SmartGallery:/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/output \
  -e BASE_INPUT_PATH=/mnt/input \
  -e BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` \
  -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` \
  -e CLI_ARGS="--admin-pass yourpassword --force-login" \
  -p 8189:8189 \
  mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery

# Exhibition container (port 8190 on host)
docker run --name smartgallery-exhibition \
  -v /your/host/output:/mnt/output \
  -v /your/host/input:/mnt/input \
  -v /your/host/SmartGallery:/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/output \
  -e BASE_INPUT_PATH=/mnt/input \
  -e BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` \
  -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` \
  -e CLI_ARGS="--exhibition --admin-pass yourpassword --blind-rating" \
  -p 8190:8189 \
  mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery
```

Docker port mapping: the syntax is `HOST:CONTAINER`. Both containers run internally on port 8189, but are reachable at `:8189` and `:8190` respectively on your machine. They share the same data volumes, so files, tags, and collections are visible in both.

</details>

### 2.3 FFmpeg Integration

FFmpeg is optional but strongly recommended. Without it, video files will not generate thumbnails, the storyboard feature will not work, and formats like ProRes, MKV, AVI, and MOV will not transcode for browser playback.

If you only work with images, you can skip this entirely.

<details>
<summary><strong>What FFmpeg enables</strong></summary>

-   Thumbnail generation for MP4, WEBM, and all transcoded formats
-   Video Storyboard: the 11-frame grid preview (`E` key in the Lightbox)
-   Interactive Audio Waveforms (`GENERATE_WAVEFORMS=true`)
-   On-the-fly transcoding of ProRes, MKV, AVI, MOV to a browser-compatible format
-   Workflow extraction from video files generated by ComfyUI

SmartGallery uses `ffprobe` (included in every FFmpeg installation) to read video metadata, and `ffmpeg` itself for transcoding. You point SmartGallery to the `ffprobe` binary via the `FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH` variable in your launch script.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install FFmpeg on Windows</strong></summary>

1.  Download a pre-built release from [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (the "Windows builds" section, for example from gyan.dev or BtbN).
2.  Extract the archive to a permanent location, for example `C:/ffmpeg`.
3.  The binaries you need are inside the `bin` folder: `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.
4.  In your `run_smartgallery.bat`, set:

```bat
set "FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH=C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffprobe.exe"
```

You do not need to add FFmpeg to your system PATH. SmartGallery only needs the full path to `ffprobe.exe`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install FFmpeg on macOS</strong></summary>

The easiest way is Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

After installation, ffprobe will typically be at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffprobe` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin/ffprobe` (Intel). Set it in your launch script:

```bash
export FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/ffprobe"
```

To confirm the path on your machine: `which ffprobe`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install FFmpeg on Linux</strong></summary>

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

On Fedora/RHEL:

```bash
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

ffprobe is installed alongside ffmpeg. The default path is usually `/usr/bin/ffprobe`. Set it in your launch script:

```bash
export FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH="/usr/bin/ffprobe"
```

To confirm: `which ffprobe`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker: nothing to install</strong></summary>

The official Docker image (`mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery`) already includes FFmpeg and ffprobe. Video transcoding, thumbnail generation, and storyboard creation all work out of the box with no additional configuration.

</details>

### 3.1.1 Sidebar Navigation

The left sidebar contains three main tabs:  

 ![Sidebar with three tabs: Folders, Collections, Status](assets/sidebar_tabs.png)

*The three-tab sidebar: Folders (directory tree), Collections (virtual albums), Status (browse by pipeline state).*

-   **📁 Folders (Physical):** Browse actual folders on your hard drive.
    -   `+` — Create a subfolder
    -   🔗 — Mount an external drive or network folder via symlink
    -   `⋮` — Rename, Delete, Unmount, or force AI Indexing on a folder
-   **📚 Collections (Virtual):** Virtual albums grouping files from different folders without moving them on disk.
-   **🏷 Status:** Browse all files by their color-coded pipeline status across every folder at once.
-   **👤 User Profile (bottom):** Shows your current role. Click 👥 to open User Management, `×` to log out.

---

### 3.1.2 Top Toolbar & Global Actions

![Top toolbar with Filters, Upload, Rescan, Refresh buttons and sort options](assets/top_main_toolbar.png)

*The top toolbar: action buttons on the left, file count and sort options on the right.*

-   **⚙️ Options:** Global settings — thumbnail size (Normal 320px / Compact 220px), video autoplay.
-   **? Shortcuts:** Full keyboard shortcut list for the current interface.
-   **⚡ Focus (Q):** Toggle Focus Mode.
-   **🕵️ My Ratings:** Quickly toggle between the global average rating view and your personal, blind rating view.
-   **📤 Upload:** Magic Upload via drag & drop. ComfyUI metadata is extracted automatically.
-   **♻️ Rescan:** Forces a background disk scan for externally added or modified files.

#### Auto-Watch & Refresh

 ![Auto-Watch popup with Enable Watch toggle and 10 second interval](assets/auto_watch.png)

*Auto-Watch: click the `⋮` next to Refresh, enable the toggle and set an interval. A pulsing red dot confirms it's active.*

-   **Manual Refresh:** Click the 🔃 icon to instantly scan for new files.
-   **Auto-Watch (`⋮`):** Silently scans in the background and injects new ComfyUI files into the grid **without a page reload**. Enable it while ComfyUI is generating to cull in real time.

---

### 3.1.3 Search & Filters

![Advanced search panel showing all filter options](assets/filter_panel.png)

*The Filters panel: search scope, multi-keyword fields, extensions, date range, and options.*

Click **🔍 Filters** to open the advanced search engine. Filters work across both physical Folders and virtual Collections.

**Search Scope:** Current Folder or Global (All Folders). Toggle *Include Subfolders* for recursive search.

**Multi-Keyword Fields** (Workflow Files, Prompt Keywords, Comment Keywords):

| Syntax | Logic | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `,` comma | **AND** — must contain both | `red, car` |
| `;` semicolon | **OR** — contains either | `cat; dog` |
| `!` exclamation | **NOT** — exclude keyword | `!lora`, `!cat` |
| `" "` quotes | **Exact Match** | `"man"` (won't match `woman`) |

*💡 **Pro Tip**: You can combine Exact Matches and Exclusions! Use `!"bad anatomy"` to completely exclude a specific phrase from your search results.*

**Extensions & Prefixes:** Filter by file type or filename prefix.

**Date Range:** Filter by generation/upload date.

**Options:** Favorites Only · No Workflow. 

**Advanced Ratings Filtering:**
You can now drill down into feedback by filtering by **Star Rating Ranges** (e.g., select '4-5 stars' and '1-2 stars' simultaneously) and by **Specific Raters** to isolate feedback from key clients or team members.

#### Sort Buttons

Sort by **Date** (📅), **Name** (🔤), **Rating** (⭐), or **Comments** (💬). 

Sorting criteria for Ratings and Comments have been upgraded with **Sub-menus**. Click the dropdown arrow next to the Rating or Comment buttons to effortlessly toggle between "Highest/Lowest Rated", **"Not Rated"**, "Most/Least Discussed", or **"Uncommented"** items. A dedicated *Newest Comments* sort orders files by the most recent activity, making it perfect for Admins to surface the latest client feedback without manually hunting through the grid.

---

### 3.1.4 Gallery Grid & Focus Mode

**Persistent Metadata Hover Bar:** 
Hovering over any image now reveals a sleek status bar at the bottom of the screen. It provides instant, real-time access to crucial file details including exact dimensions, calculated megapixels, file size, and current rating status without needing to open the Lightbox.

**Standard Grid View (Focus Mode OFF):** Hovering over an image reveals the quick-action card with Node Summary (📝), Favorite (⭐), Download (💾), Delete (🗑️). Clicking opens the Lightbox.

![Standard Grid View — Focus Mode OFF, showing hover cards with action buttons](assets/focus_mode_off.png)

*Standard Grid View (Focus OFF): two files selected (blue checkmarks), hover card visible, batch bar at the bottom.*

**Focus Mode ON (`Q`):** Hides all UI chrome, metadata, titles, and quick-action cards. A golden star marks favorites. Selected items show a massive **fuchsia border**. Use keyboard arrows to navigate. Click or press `V`/`Enter` to open the Lightbox.

![Focus Mode ON — clean grid with fuchsia selection borders](assets/focus_mode_active.png)

*Focus Mode ON: all clutter removed, fuchsia border on the selected file, batch bar still accessible.*

> **Power User Tip:** Enable Auto-Watch, activate Focus Mode with `Q`, then use `←→` arrows + `Del`/`F`/`X` to blaze through a batch while it's still generating. Press `I` on any item to view its exact file path and linked real-source mapping (crucial for diagnosing mounted external drives).

---

### 3.1.5 Batch Selection Bar

Click the checkmark `✓` on any image (or `Space`/`X` in Focus Mode) to select it. The floating **Selection Bar** appears at the bottom.

![Batch selection bar with context menu expanded showing all batch actions](assets/batch_selection_bar.png)

*Batch selection bar: 2 files selected (fuchsia borders), context menu open with all available batch actions.*

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ✕ Deselect All | `Esc` | Clears the selection |
| ✅ Select All | `Ctrl+A` | Selects all visible files |
| ↔️ Range Select | — | Appears when exactly 2 files selected; selects all between them |
| ⭐ Add Favorite | — | Marks all selected as favorites |
| 🏷 Set Status | `Y` | Apply a pipeline color tag to the batch |
| 📚 Add/Remove Collections | `A` | Add or remove batch from virtual albums |
| ⚖️ Compare Selected | — | Split-screen comparison (exactly 2 files required) |
| 🏅 Rate Selected | `Shift+R` | Apply 1–5 stars to multiple files at once |
| 📁 Move / Copy | `M` | Transfer files to another physical folder |
| 📦 Download as Zip | `Z` | Package selection into a downloadable `.zip` |
| ☆ Remove Favorite | — | Remove the favorite flag from the batch |
| 🗑️ Delete Selected | `Del` | Permanently delete selected files |

---

## 3.2 Advanced Media Inspection

### 3.2.1 The Lightbox (Media Viewer)

Open the full-screen Lightbox with `V` or `Enter`. When Focus Mode is OFF, clicking an image also works.

![Lightbox open with Node Summary panel on the left, image in center, Ratings & Comments panel on the right](assets/lightbox_node_summary.png)

*The Lightbox: Node Summary panel (left), full-resolution image (center), Ratings & Comments panel (right). All three panels can be shown or hidden independently.*

**Enhanced Player Controls:** The custom video/audio player now supports Spacebar to Play/Pause, arrow keys to seek by 5 seconds, and full volume/mute controls (Shortcut `M`).

**Dynamic Audio Waveforms:** If `GENERATE_WAVEFORMS=true` is set, visual audio tracks will map onto the seek bar. A dedicated amplitude slider (🌊) lets you visually boost or reduce the waveform height in real time—a rare feature that saves you from needing to regenerate the media file.

**Toolbar Buttons:**

| Button | Key | Description |
|---|---|---|
| / MENU | `/` | Touch-friendly list of all commands |

| ↗️ Open in New Tab | `O` | Full-resolution in a new browser tab |
| 🗑️ Delete | `Del` | Delete the file |
| × Exit | `Esc` | Return to Grid View |

---

### 3.2.2 ComfyUI Node Summary (📝)

Press `N` on any image (in the grid or in the Lightbox) to open the Node Summary.

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%" valign="top">
      <img src="assets/improved-node-summary.png" height="350"><br>
      <em>Node Summary dashboard: positive prompt with one-click Copy, and all generation parameters at a glance.</em>

### 3.2.3 Remix Workflow & The { } Nodepad (✦)

**The Philosophy: "Suffer Only Once on the Canvas"**  
ComfyUI is incredibly powerful, but its node-based interface can be overwhelming. The philosophy behind the Remix feature is simple: *endure building your perfect node setup once*. Once you generate your media, let SmartGallery steal its "soul", extract the parameters, and save it as a clean Template. You will never have to look at the node canvas again. [**▶️ Video**](https://smartgallerydam.com/nodepad.mp4)

![Remix Overlay with press B activation](assets/press_b.png)
*The Remix Engine: select an image, press B, and gain full control over the generation pipeline.*

Getting started is immediate: just select an image or video in your gallery and press <kbd>B</kbd>. SmartGallery dynamically adapts to your workflow's complexity, offering three distinct spaces to work in:

#### 1️⃣ Simple Tweaks: 📝 Auto-Form
This is the engine room. SmartGallery aggressively scans the embedded workflow and automatically exposes the most important editable parameters (Prompts, Seeds, Steps, Denoise, Dimensions, etc.).  
**Best for:** Basic workflows where you just need to change the prompt and hit the **🚀 Queue** button.

#### 2️⃣ Build Your Dashboard: 🛠️ My Panel
If your Auto-Form is cluttered, build your own interface! Click the **📌 Pin icon** next to the inputs you care about in the Auto-Form. Switch to **My Panel**, and you will find a clean dashboard populated *exclusively* with your pinned fields. Use the **↕ Reorder** button to drag and drop them into a perfect sequence.  
**Best for:** Creating a clean, distraction-free generator isolating just the key parameters needed for daily operations.

![My Panel](assets/my_panel.png)

#### 3️⃣ Pro Control: { } The Nodepad (The Game Changer)
No other software on the market offers this level of control. The **Nodepad** is a revolutionary raw JSON editor designed for power users and prompt engineers. If a custom node isn't supported by the Auto-Form, edit its raw JSON directly here.

*   **Live Dictionary Lookup:** As long as your ComfyUI server is online, the Nodepad directly interrogates it. Click on any node, and SmartGallery instantly downloads the official definitions and allowed options for that specific node directly from the ComfyUI backend.
*   **The Magic Injector:** You don't have to type strict JSON manually. The Nodepad generates visual UI elements—like Comboboxes for node options, or Upload buttons for images/videos. Select a value, and watch the underlying JSON rewrite and format itself magically!
*   **Intelligent JSON Formatting:** The Nodepad visually converts escaped characters into *physical newlines* for easy reading, then automatically sanitizes them back into valid `\n` code upon saving to prevent ComfyUI syntax errors.
*   **The "Favorite" Node System:** If a custom node is too complex, open it in the Nodepad and click **⭐ Favorite**. That entire node will instantly become a "Quick Edit" button inside your clean **My Panel** dashboard!

![Nodepad](assets/dictionary_lookup.png)

#### The Workflow Library & Queueing
Once you have pinned your fields and favorited your complex nodes inside **My Panel**, click **⭐ Save to Library**. You can recall these templates at any time from the main Tools menu without needing a source image. When ready, set your Generation Count, toggle the **Random Seed**, and click **🚀 Queue**.

SmartGallery keeps Remix jobs in a durable local queue. Open **🖥 Backends & Jobs** to add multiple LAN ComfyUI servers and order them from fastest to slowest. A job is sent only when a backend has no running or pending work; otherwise it waits locally until the first preferred backend becomes available. Jobs survive SmartGallery restarts.

Remote input media is uploaded to the selected backend automatically. Final ComfyUI output images and videos are downloaded into `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH/Remix` with collision-resistant names and indexed immediately so they appear in the gallery. Temporary previews and intermediate files are not imported.

`COMFYUI_SERVER_URL` remains supported as a bootstrap setting: on first migration it becomes the initial backend, and further backend management happens in the Remix UI.

![Queue](assets/remix_queue.png)

#### Video Companion PNGs & Autofix
Video files (MP4/WebM) generated by ComfyUI sometimes lack the full "API Workflow" data required for direct queuing. If you see a warning, just click the blue **🔍 Find companion PNG** button. SmartGallery will automatically locate the VHS sidecar image, extract the hidden data, and restore your ability to queue the video directly!

![Companion PNG Warning](assets/companion_png.png)

---

### 3.2.4 Compare Mode  

Select exactly **2 files**, click `⋮` in the Selection Bar → **Compare Selected**.

![Compare Mode with A/B slider on a mandrill image, and Parameter Differences table below](assets/compare2.png)

*Compare Mode: drag the central handle to compare the two images. The Parameter Differences table below shows only the values that changed between the two generations.*

-   **Visual Slider:** Drag the central handle to compare. Videos synchronize automatically.
-   **Parameter Differences (`I`):** Table showing only the parameters that changed (e.g., CFG: 4.0 → 8.0, different prompt, different LoRA weights).

---

### 3.2.5 Video Storyboard (🎞)

Press `E` in the Lightbox on any video file.

![Video Storyboard showing 11 evenly-spaced frames of an elephant video](assets/storyboard.png)

*Video Storyboard: 11 perfectly spaced frames extracted from the video. Click any frame to zoom in with timestamp data.*

SmartGallery uses FFmpeg to extract **11 perfectly spaced frames** and display them in a grid, letting you evaluate the entire motion arc and consistency at a glance — without scrubbing.

---

## 3.3 Digital Asset Management (DAM) & Communication

### 3.3.1 Virtual Collections & Sharing

Collections are **virtual albums** — group files from different physical folders without moving them on disk.

 ![Collections sidebar tab with context menu open, and Manage Collections modal on the right](assets/collections.jpg)

*Left: Collections sidebar tab with the context menu (Rename, Set as Exhibition Ready, Delete). Right: Manage Collections modal — add or remove the selected file from any collection, with pending changes shown.*

-   **Create:** Collections tab in the sidebar → `+` → name it → choose Public, Private, or select specific users.
-   **Add files:** Select files → click 📚 in the Selection Bar or press `A`.
-   **Untag (`U`):** Remove files from the current collection without deleting them from disk.

#### Exhibition Ready vs. Private vs. Shared

Click `⋮` next to any collection to manage visibility:

-   **Private (default):** Strictly internal. Invisible to clients and guests.
-   **Exhibition Ready 👁:** Pushed to the Exhibition Portal, visible to ALL clients and guests.
-   **Shared Access 👥:** Click "Share / Permissions" to assign a collection *exclusively* to specific clients or users.

---

### 3.3.2 Pipeline Status Tags

 ![Status tab in the sidebar showing all 5 tags: Approved (green), Review (yellow), To Edit (blue), Rejected (red), Select (purple)](assets/statuses.png)

*The Status tab: all five pipeline states with their color coding and the keyboard shortcut for each.*

The **Status tab** in the sidebar lets you browse all files at a given pipeline stage, across every folder at once.

**How to assign:** hover over an image (or select a batch) and press:

| Key | Status | Color |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | Approved | Green |  
| `2` | Rejected | Red |  
| `3` | Review | Yellow |
| `4` | Select | Purple |  
| `5` | To Edit | Blue |  
| `0` | Remove status | — |

![Thumbnails with color status bars on the left edge](assets/status_color_vertical_strips.png)

*A vertical color bar on the left edge of each thumbnail indicates the file's pipeline status. No bar = no status assigned.*

You can also use `Y` to open the tagging modal on a batch selection. Status tags are entirely optional.

---

### 3.3.3 Ratings & Comments (⭐💬)

Both interfaces share a **unified communication database**. Press `G` on any image to open the Ratings & Comments panel.

 ![Ratings & Comments panel showing global rating 3.5, your vote, collections & status, comment count](assets/main_rating_comments_panel.png)

*The Ratings & Comments panel: Global Rating (average of all users), your personal vote with Reset button, file's collections and pipeline status, and comment thread.*

#### Ratings & Transparency

-   Click ⭐ stars (1–5) to cast a personal vote. Click 🗑 **Reset** to remove it.
-   **Global Rating** = average of all users (staff + clients in Exhibition).
-   **Rating Details (👁️):** Click the "Details" icon next to the global rating to see exactly *who* voted and what rating they gave.
-   **Blind Rating Mode:** Use `--blind-rating` at launch to force users to rate without seeing the global average, eliminating group bias. 
-   **Batch rating:** select multiple files → press `Shift+R`.

#### Comments & Visibility

 ![Comments thread showing Direct Message from STAFF to John Doe, and Private Staff Only message from client. Visibility dropdown open with Public and Private options](assets/comments_target_audience.png)

*Comments thread: a STAFF Direct Message (To: John Doe) and a Private (Staff Only) message from the client. The visibility dropdown is open showing all options.*

When writing a comment, choose who can read it from the dropdown:

| Visibility | Who sees it |
|---|---|
| 🌐 **Public (Everyone)** | All users in both Main Workspace and Exhibition |
| 🔒 **Internal / Private (Staff Only)** | Only Admin, Manager, Staff — clients never see these |
| 👤 **Direct Message (To: User)** | Only that specific user and Staff — click a username to pre-select |

Every message displays a colored badge showing its visibility at a glance. Comment text is **fully searchable** from the Filters panel.

## 3.4 User Management & Access Control

If you work alone, skip this section — the system works without it.

 ![User Management panel with role table and user creation form](assets/user_management_modal.png)

*User Management panel: role permissions table (Admin/Manager/Staff, Friend, User/Customer/Guest), user registration form, and login timestamp tracking.*

Click the 👥 icon at the bottom of the sidebar to open the User Management panel.

### Role Permissions

| Role | Main Interface | Exhibition | Workflows | Downloads |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **admin / MANAGER / STAFF** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full access | Original + JSON workflows |
| **FRIEND** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Visible in metadata | Original files (with embedded metadata) |
| **USER / CUSTOMER / GUEST** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Hidden | Clean/stripped only |

-   **admin:** The built-in root user. Case-sensitive — always **lowercase**. Password set via `--admin-pass`.
-   **MANAGER / STAFF:** Full access to Main Interface. Can read and respond to all comments.
-   **FRIEND:** Exhibition only. Downloads original files (metadata intact, but Node Summary panel not available).
-   **USER / CUSTOMER / GUEST:** Exhibition only. All downloads are metadata-stripped — no workflow can be recovered even with external tools.
-   **Guest (anonymous):** With `--enable-guest-login`, anonymous users browse Exhibition without an account; they choose a nickname before posting their first comment.

### User Analytics

The User Manager panel now displays the **Last Login timestamp** for every user. You can easily sort the user list by this timestamp, making it incredibly easy for admins to monitor client activity and see exactly who has recently engaged with the Exhibition portal.

### Creating a User Account

Fill in: **User ID** (login name) · **Password** (min. 8 chars) · **Full Name** (display name) · **Email** (optional) · **Phone** (optional) · **Role** · **Expiration** (optional) · **Active** toggle.

## 3.5 The Exhibition Portal (Client Hub)

**Access:** Launch with `--exhibition`, typically on port 8190.

### 3.5.1 Exhibition Interface Overview

![Exhibition Portal grid showing curated collections with ratings and comment counts on each card](assets/hero_exhibition_portal.png)

*The Exhibition Portal: clean, curated grid showing only assigned/public collections. Each card shows the rating and comment count. No prompts, no folders, no workflow data visible.*

The Exhibition portal is designed for non-technical users — clients, art directors, friends.

-   **Strictly Read-Only:** Guests can vote and comment; they cannot delete, move, rename, or alter files.
-   **Metadata Stripped:** Workflows, prompts, and EXIF are completely hidden. Downloads are always clean.
-   **Curated View:** Guests see only public collections OR collections explicitly shared with them by the Admin.
-   **Blind Rating System:** If the server is launched with `--blind-rating`, clients will only see their own ratings, ensuring completely unbiased feedback.

**Grid & Navigation:**
-   **Sidebar:** Switch between collections, search by collection name.
-   **Sorting:** Newest · Top Rated · Latest Commented · Most Commented · A-Z.
-   **Media Cards:** Each thumbnail shows the global average rating (★) and comment count (💬).

---

### 3.5.2 Theater Mode (Exhibition Lightbox)

![Theater Mode in Exhibition showing image with ratings panel open on the right, with comment thread and post form](assets/theater_comments_panel.png)

*Theater Mode: full-resolution image with the Ratings & Comments panel open. Shows the global average rating, the user's personal vote, and a comment thread with visibility badges.*

Clicking any image opens it in the **Theater** — the Exhibition's version of the Lightbox.

-   **Media Controls:** Zoom (`+`/`-`), Rotate (`T`), Download (`S`), Open in New Tab (`O`).
-   **Rating & Comment Panel (`G`):**
    -   Rate 1–5 stars by clicking or pressing `1`–`5` on keyboard; `0` to clear.
    -   Read messages addressed to you and public messages.
    -   Post comments as Public (everyone) or Private (staff only).
-   **Mobile:** Comments panel collapsed by default; tap 💬 **Show Comments** to expand.

## 4. ADVANCED TOPICS & REFERENCE

### 4.1 Sharing Online

By default SmartGallery runs on your local network. If you want to reach it from outside your home or share Exhibition with clients over the internet, you have two options: a **reverse proxy** (if you have a server or VPS with a domain), or a **tunnel service** (if you just want to share quickly with no server).

In both cases: Exhibition (port 8190) is designed for external access. The Main Interface (port 8189) can also be exposed externally, but always use `--admin-pass` and `--force-login` when you do.

<details>
<summary><strong>Reverse Proxy with Nginx</strong></summary>

Use this if you have a server, VPS, or NAS running Nginx and want SmartGallery accessible at a clean URL or on port 80/443. Configure one block per instance.

```nginx
# Main Interface (port 8189)
location /studio/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8189/galleryout/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}

# Exhibition (port 8190)
location /gallery/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8190/galleryout/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

You can also dedicate a full subdomain to each instance (e.g. `studio.yourdomain.com` and `gallery.yourdomain.com`) using separate `server {}` blocks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Reverse Proxy with Apache</strong></summary>

Requires `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http` enabled (`a2enmod proxy proxy_http`).

```apache
# Main Interface (port 8189)
<Location "/studio/">
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8189/galleryout/
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8189/galleryout/
</Location>

# Exhibition (port 8190)
<Location "/gallery/">
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8190/galleryout/
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8190/galleryout/
</Location>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>No server? Share Exhibition with a tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, and others)</strong></summary>

If you do not have a server or a domain name but want to share Exhibition with a client or friend outside your local network, tunnel services are the fastest solution. They create a public URL that forwards directly to your local machine, with no router configuration, no static IP, and no hosting fees.

**ngrok** (free tier works for personal use, runs on Windows, macOS, Linux)

Install:

```bash
# macOS
brew install ngrok

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc
echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok

# Windows: download the .exe from ngrok.com/download
```

Start your Exhibition instance first, then open the tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8190
```

ngrok prints a public URL like `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`. Share that with your client. It stays active as long as ngrok is running. On the free tier the URL changes every time you restart.

**Alternatives:**

-   **Cloudflare Tunnel** (free, no bandwidth limit, stable permanent URL): best for recurring or long-term sharing. Requires a free Cloudflare account. See [developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/).
-   **Tailscale**: creates a private mesh network between your devices. Better suited for trusted collaborators or family than for anonymous client access.
-   **Localtunnel**: no account needed, instant setup. Run `npx localtunnel --port 8190`. Less stable for long sessions.

You can tunnel just Exhibition, just the Main Interface, or both. Exhibition is built for external access. The Main Interface is also safe to expose remotely (useful for culling from your phone or working with a distributed team), as long as `--admin-pass` and `--force-login` are active.

Docker users: the same approach works identically. Run your Exhibition container with `-p 8190:8189`, then point ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel at port 8190 on your host.
